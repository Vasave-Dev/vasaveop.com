                      <h5>Stage 3: Get Certified</h5>
                      <p>To qualify for this cybersecurity certification, you must pass the exam and have at least 5 years of cumulative, paid work experience in two or more of the eight domains.</p>
                      <p>There are 2 possible “work experience” variations, one is full-time and the second is part-time. Full time would require a 35h/week for 4 weeks to get a month of work experience. Part-time would require no less than 20h/week and no more than 34h/week for 4 weeks to acquire a month of work experience.</p>
