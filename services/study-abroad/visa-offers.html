                      <h2>Study Visa</h2>
                      <p>Study visa is exactly that, it’s a visa that lets you stay in a country under the intention that you are there to study as a student, though study visa requirements can differ depending on the country you want to study in.</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>In the UK study visas are known as a Student Visa. It is for students aged 16 and above. You must first be offered a place on a course by a licensed student sponsor and have a sufficient amount of funds saved up to help support yourself in day to day necessities and housing, if you need financial advice please feel free to contact us.</li>
                          <li>In the United States study visas known as Student Visa (F or M) are required for the sole purpose of studying, any other visa type will not allow you to study there. It is important to have the proper documentation when applying for a Visa, if you need any help understanding the process please contact us.</li>
                          <li>In Canada a study permit is required of all international students of all kinds, to apply for this permit in order to be able to study there, you must first answer some questions to assess if you are eligible or not. Then once approved you must apply for a Visitor visa or Electronic travel authorisation (eTA) to enter the country. A study permit is not a Visa. For more clarification on what you need to prepare and steps to take, please contact us.</li>

                      <p>Applying for a business visa means that you would like to enter a country under the presumption that your intention is to temporarily stay to attend business functions and purposes.</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>To get a business visa for entry into the UK, is usually a standard visitor visa under the category of ‘Investor-business development and talent visas’ section. If you're a new start-up entrepreneur, who wants to set up business in the UK then it’s recommended you get an innovator or start-up visa.</li>
                          <li>To apply for a business visa in the US, you need to check whether you're in a participating country because if you are you may not even need a visa to enter. Though if you do, then you most likely need a visitor visa (B-1) to travel for temporary business matters. For more advice, please contact our team.</li>
                          <li>To gain a business visa for entry to Canada you would apply for a visitor visa with an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) and valid passport, as well as state that you are staying for less than 6 month. For more information on eligibility please contact us to make sure you are applying for the correct visa.   </li>
